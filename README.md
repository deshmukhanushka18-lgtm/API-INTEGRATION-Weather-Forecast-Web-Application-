The Weather Forecast Web Application is a responsive web-based system designed to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information for both single and multiple cities. The application displays key weather parameters such as current temperature, minimum and maximum temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and overall weather conditions in a clean and structured interface.

The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on dynamic content rendering and user experience. Weather data is retrieved through a third-party Weather API using asynchronous JavaScript techniques, ensuring non-blocking data fetching and smooth performance. The application supports real-time data updates and efficiently processes API responses to display relevant information.

To enhance reliability, the system includes error handling mechanisms for invalid city inputs, network issues, and API limitations. In cases where live data cannot be fetched, fallback logic ensures that the user interface remains functional and visually consistent. The application is fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes, making it accessible across desktop and mobile devices.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of API integration, DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and responsive web design. It highlights problem-solving skills and the ability to build real-world web applications with reliable data handling and an intuitive user interface.
